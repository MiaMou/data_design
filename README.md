Rails 6
This project is also a chance to explore Rails 6, and it's changes. There will be notes here about what's working and which guides have been useful for me and this project. This will become part of the course I teach on Ruby and Rails at the University of Aberdeen. The practicals and 'deliberate practice' sessions can be found at https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/b.scharlau/pages/rails-pages/

These guides to Rails 6 seems to have some useful pointers https://dev.to/vvo/a-rails-6-setup-guide-for-2019-and-2020-hf5 https://medium.com/@adrian_teh/ruby-on-rails-6-with-webpacker-and-bootstrap-step-by-step-guide-41b52ef4081f
